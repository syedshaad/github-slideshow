        <h3>
            Basics
        </h3>
        <p1>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language.<br>
             It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.<br>
             It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.</p1>
            <h3><li>Step 1: Figure Out What Motivates You to Learn Python</li></h3> 
        <p2>
            Before you start diving into learning Python online, it’s worth asking yourself why you want to learn it.<br>
             This is because it’s going to be a long and sometimes painful journey.<br>
              Without enough motivation, you probably won’t make it through.<br>
               For example, I slept through high school and college programming classes when I had to memorize syntax and I wasn’t motivated.<br>
                On the other hand, when I needed to use Python to build a website to automatically score essays, I stayed up nights to finish it.<br>
            

Figuring out what motivates you will help you figure out an end goal, and a path that gets you there without boredom.<br>
 You don’t have to figure out an exact project, just a general area you’re interested in as you prepare to learn Python.<br>

Pick an area you’re interested in, such as:
         <ul>
             <li>Data science / Machine learning</li>
             <li>Mobile apps</li>
             <li>Websites</li>
             <li>Data processing and analysis</li>
             <li>Hardware / Sensors / Robots</li>
<li>Games</li>
<li>Hardware / Sensors / Robots</li>
<li>Scripts to automate your work</li>
         </ul>
        
        <img src="C:\Users\SHAAD AHMED\Desktop\kll.jpg" alt="robot" width="500" height="333"></p2><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
        <p3>
            Yes, you can make robots using Python! From the Raspberry Pi Cookbook.
        </p3>
        <p4>Figure out one or two areas that interest you, and you’re willing to stick with.<br>
             You’ll be gearing your learning towards them, and eventually will be building projects in them.</p4>

   <h3>
    <li>Step 2: Learn the Basic Syntax</li>
   </h3>
   <p5>
    Unfortunately, this step can’t be skipped. You have to learn the very basics of Python syntax before you dive deeper into your chosen area.<br>
     You want to spend the minimum amount of time on this, as it isn’t very motivating.
   </p5>



   <p6>Here are some good resources to help you learn the basics:</p6>
   <ul>
       <li>Learn Python the Hard Way — a book that teaches Python concepts from the basics to more in-depth programs.</li>
          <li>Dataquest – Python for Data Science Fundamentals Course — I started Dataquest to make learning Python and data science easier. Dataquest teaches Python syntax in the context of learning data science.<br>
             For example, you’ll learn about for loops while analyzing weather data.</li>
          <li>The Python Tutorial — the tutorial on the main Python site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p7>
        I can’t emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of time possible on basic syntax. The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn. You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later. You should ideally only spend a couple of weeks on this phase, and definitely no more than a month.

Also, a quick note: learn Python 3, not Python 2.<br>
 Unfortunately a lot of "learn Python" resources online still teach Python 2, but you should definitely learn Python 3.<br>
 Python 2 is no longer supported, so bugs and security holes will not be fixed!
    </p7>
    <h3>  <li>Step 3: Make Structured Projects</h3></li>
<p8>
    Once you’ve learned the basic syntax, it’s possible to start making projects on your own. Projects are a great way to learn, because they let you apply your knowledge. Unless you apply your knowledge, it will be hard to retain it.<br>
     Projects will push your capabilities, help you learn new things, and help you build a portfolio to show to potential employers.
</p8> 
<p9>
    However, very freeform projects at this point will be painful — you’ll get stuck a lot, and need to refer to documentation. Because of this, it’s usually better to make more structured projects until you feel comfortable enough to make projects completely on your own.<br>
    Many learning resources offer structured projects, and these projects let you build interesting things in the areas you care about while still preventing you from getting stuck.
</p9>
<p10>
    Let’s look at some good resources for structured projects in each area:
</p10>
<p11>
<h5>Data science / Machine learning</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Dataquest — Teaches you Python and data science interactively. You analyze a series of interesting datasets ranging from CIA documents to NBA player stats.<br>
         You eventually build complex algorithms, including neural networks and decision trees.</li>
    <li>Python for Data Analysis — written by the author of a major Python data analysis library, it’s a good <br>
        introduction to analyzing data in Python.</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn documentation — Scikit-learn is the main Python machine learning library. It has some great documentation and tutorials.</li>
    <li>CS109 — this is a Harvard class that teaches Python for data science. They have some of their projects and other materials online.</li>
    
</ul></p11>
<p12><h5>
    Mobile Apps
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Kivy guide — Kivy is a tool that lets you make mobile apps with Python.<br> 
        They have a guide on how to get started.</li>
    </ul></p12>
     <p13>
         <h5>Websites</h5>
     <ul>
        <li>Bottle tutorial — Bottle is another web framework for Python.<br>
             This is how to get started with it</li>
        <li>How To Tango With Django — A guide to using Django, a complex Python web framework</li>
        </ul></p13>
        <p14><h5>Games</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Codecademy — walks you through making a couple of simple games.</li>
            <li>Pygame tutorials — Pygame is a popular<br>
                 Python library for making games, and this is a list of tutorials for it</li>
                 <li>Making games with Pygame — A book that teaches you how to make games in Python.</li>
   <li>

   </li>
   </ul>
